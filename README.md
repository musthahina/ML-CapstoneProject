# Atmospheric Temperature Prediction Model
Name: MUSTHAHINA P \
Organization: Entri ElevateÂ¶
## Objective :
To develop a predictive model that estimates air temperature based on key meteorological factors such as humidity, wind speed, barometric pressure, solar radiation, and precipitation. This model aims to enhance weather forecasting, climate analysis, and support informed decision-making for outdoor activities and emergency response strategies.
